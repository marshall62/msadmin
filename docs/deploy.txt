For routine deployment to rose:

location: /mnt/net/django/msadmin

If changes have been made to the msadminsite/settings.py file make a safe copy of the version on rose because it has settings
in it that are different than the ones on a dev machine.  This file is omitted from the git repo (via .gitignore) so new versions need to moved onto
rose using scp

ssh marshall@rose.cs.umass.edu
cd /mnt/net/django/msadmin
git pull

hand-merge the safe copy of settings.py with the one being moved using scp.
---------------------
I have a deploy.sh script that does moving of static resources into apache.  Run it in mnt/net/django/msadmin by
./deploy.sh

OR DO:
-------------------
Set
export STATIC_ROOT='/mnt/net/http/msadmin_static/'

Run the command to move static into above dir so apache serves
cd /mnt/net/django/msadmin
source env-msadmin-py3-4/bin/activate
(venv)python manage.py collectstatic -n
This will pretend to move the files.  Verify that it moves them to the correct place and then do:
(venv)python manage.py collectstatic

Alternative to the above is to move files by hand from /msadmin_static into /mnt/net/http/msadmin_static

Make sure database tables have been updated if necessary (see below)

restart apache.
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart

deactivate // will leave the virtualenv
