THe class page within strategies should be made more generally useful for configuring all elements of classes.
Would like to be able to config the current system (e.g. set the pre/post test in the classconfig and turn on post test).
Would like to be able to see its pedagogies.  Other things in the class config should be editable here with the strategy being an accordion area
or separated from it better.

Need Topic editing where I can set intro and edit/save HTML as files on rose.  Means reading existing HTML files and putting code into editor window
and resave.

Need multiple CCSS on problem because multiple CCSS allows example and video selection to work well and will be better in general for understanding what the content is


add lastWriter, creator, lastWriteTime, createTime to hint.

Mathspring:  Check to see if teacher creation with invalid fields (e.g. user exists) gives error back to dialog.

Mathspring:  Make sure uses of problem snapshots are working and fix to have URL within mscontent.

Db:  A beta db that MSAdmin talks to and that woj talks to.
Just need a forward migration script to push necessary tables from beta db to production and disallow use of beta for
collection of student data.
