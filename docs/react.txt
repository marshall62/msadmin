To use react:

Set the Javascript level of Intellij to ES 6 + React by:

File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Javascript | React JSX

Use these URLS in the the HTML file:

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Set Intellij to use the File Watcher plugin

Browser for the File Watcher plugin and install it.

Set up the File Watcher to use Babel to transpile ES6 code to ES5 Javascript.

Make sure nodejs and npm are installed

npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev
